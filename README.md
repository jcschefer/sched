# schedule
get the current TJ bell schedule from the command line

Run with the command <code>$ go run sched.go</code>

To see the order of days in the week, run <code>$ go run sched.go week</code>

Wouldn't have thought of the whole Makefile thing without Alex Wang (mabotkin on GitHub).

Installation: run <code>$ make install</code> (you may have to run as root)

Removal: run <code>$ make uninstall</code> (you may have to run as root)
